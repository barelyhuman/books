# Preface

Hey readers,

I'm reaper (Siddharth Gelera),

This book is a tiny attempt at sharing knowledge from my journey as a developer.
I've been playing with bytes and bits for around 6 years now. I'm what you could
call _just a programmer_, nothing special or groundbreaking here but, there's
things I've learned that I'd like to simplify for others.

Being someone who's fond of learning both from other's and my own endeavours has
given me the perspective that there's never a single solution. You can always
solve the problem in a different and maybe even a much improved way. Though,
there's a few of these that I've solved repeatedly over the years; one such
problem has been **_dealing with multi timezone apps_**.

The web, the sea of information as some might call wasn't very helpful when I
tried to look for ways to be able to compute and work with dates in different
zones and translate them around for my requirement. "**Just use UTC**", they
said; fading away into the abyss of bytes online.

"I wish it was that simple", I thought to myself while thinking about what a
complicated beast the younger reaper had to deal with.

With that out of the way, let's get to actually working with it.
